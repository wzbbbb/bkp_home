Questions:
Is there a way to open a specific GJM connection to a specific node via the command line?  I am able to open the "multi-node" window via the command line but if I try to specify a particular node (rather than multi-node) a GJM window opens with the monitored node left blank (and, of course, the CDJ connection fails).

What I want to do is create various scripts to open groups of GJM windows - rather than requiring users to manually open all of the needed windows.



Explanation:

We do not have any document about the syntax of this command:
GraphicJobMonitor.exe 
We are not sure if this binary will accept a parameter for single node. This binary is not designed to be used in script. You may figure out a way to do it for now. However, it is possible that our R&D team changes the command syntax in future, since it is not documented for customers.

An alternative could be to limit the nodes defined in the node table.
