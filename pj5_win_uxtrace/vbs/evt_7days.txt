Message: The system failed to register host (A) resource records (RRs) for
network adapter
with settings:


  Adapter Name : {A0B7F781-0DF0-48CF-9B6D-135D4244D0FD}

  Host Name : USSDMDA007

  Primary Domain Suffix : orsypgroup.com

  Sent update to server : <?>

  IP Address(es) :

    192.168.105.7


The reason the system could not register these RRs was because the
DNS server contacted refused the update request. The reasons for this
might be (a) you are not allowed to update the specified DNS domain name,
or (b) because the DNS server authoritative for this name does not support
the DNS dynamic update protocol.


To register the DNS host (A) resource records using the specific DNS
domain name and IP addresses for this adapter, contact your DNS server
or network systems administrator.

The reason the system could not register these RRs was because the
DNS server contacted refused the update request. The reasons for this
might be (a) you are not allowed to update the specified DNS domain name,
or (b) because the DNS server authoritative for this name does not support
the DNS dynamic update protocol.


To register the DNS host (A) resource records using the specific DNS
domain name and IP addresses for this adapter, contact your DNS server
or network systems administrator.

The reason the system could not register these RRs was because the

might be (a) you are not allowed to update the specified DNS domain name,
or (b) because the DNS server authoritative for this name does not support
the DNS dynamic update protocol.


To register the DNS host (A) resource records using the specific DNS

network adapter

  Adapter Name : {A0B7F781-0DF0-48CF-9B6D-135D4244D0FD}

  Host Name : USSDMDA007

  Primary Domain Suffix : orsypgroup.com

  Sent update to server : <?>

  IP Address(es) :

    192.168.105.7


The reason the system could not register these RRs was because the
DNS server contacted refused the update request. The reasons for this
might be (a) you are not allowed to update the specified DNS domain name,
or (b) because the DNS server authoritative for this name does not support
the DNS dynamic update protocol.


To register the DNS host (A) resource records using the specific DNS
domain name and IP addresses for this adapter, contact your DNS server
or network systems administrator.
