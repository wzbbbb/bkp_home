	On Unix, user table distribution failed

Application validation tests:

	It may get fixed in 5.2.1 or 5.3

Explanation:

	On all Unix
	When distributing user table, Dollar Universe needs to create some temporary files in the remote $UXEXE directory. After applying the uxright script, the $UXEXE will become 555. Unless the remote uxech process is running under root, the user table distribution can not be completed.

	In the remote universe.log file, the following error will show up:

	<< 2005-09-27 15:24:49 1876170/uxech           /DFADME32            /134578284 - %UNI_-F-U_EU_SGDS0102, Fatal error writing extraction file, please check its address


	Some sample temporary files look like the following:
	       129 -rw-rw-rw-   1 root     other      50535 Nov  1 10:22 USERS_TABLE_20051101_102241.SAV
	       132 -rw-rw-rw-   1 root     other      50535 Nov  1 10:24 USERS_TABLE_20051101_102419.SAV


	The workaround would be to make the $UXEXE writeable to add the "univa" (the owner of the uxech process).
