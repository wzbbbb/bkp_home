Explanation:
A submission user needs to be both a Dollar Universe user and a Unix system user. 
If you are using proxy, you may also need to update the proxy setting. 

The system user created normally have the same name as the Dollar Universe user; and belongs to the same group as other submission users. Usually, there is a dedicated user group for Dollar Universe users in the Unix system.
