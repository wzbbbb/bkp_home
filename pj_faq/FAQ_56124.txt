Subject: When launching a remote provoked task, the local $U user need to exist on target node

Prerequisites:

Application validation tests:

Explanation:


uxordre considers the $U user on the local system, instead of the local (for example, Windows) system user.
When launching a provoked task on a remote node, the user on local and remote node need to be the same case, for example zwa is not the same as ZWA.

Proxy is not used in this example.
For example. launch from window GCO node to a Linux node. Windows user map to ZWA $U user with useralias.txt, and there is only a zwa on the Unix $U. The uxordre command won't work:

E:\du\TST511\exec>uxordre upr=C56532_2 mu=CASDLSUP06  node=casdlsup06
Access denied - insufficient rights

If both side $U user is zwa it will work:
E:\du\TST511\exec>uxordre upr=C56532_2 mu=CASDLSUP06  node=casdlsup06
