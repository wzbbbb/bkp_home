Explanation:

	The useralias.txt file is used to map Windows users to Dollar Universe users. Let's consider the following entries:
	Domain1           user1                 univa 
	NT1               univa                 univa 
	There are 3 columns in each line. The first one is the host/domain of the user; the second one is the Windows user name; the last column is the Dollar Universe name.
	The first line maps the user1 from Windows domain Domain1 to Dollar Universe user univa. The second line maps Winodws local user univa on the node NT1 to Dollar Universe univa.
