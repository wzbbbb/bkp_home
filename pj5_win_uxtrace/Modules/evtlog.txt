Message: The system failed to register network adapter with settings:


  Adapter Name : {56AC15EF-0386-45EF-A083-972E551D00C3}

  Host Name : support4

  Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : orsypgroup.com

  DNS server list :

    81.255.91.103, 38.9.221.2

  Sent update to server : None

  IP Address(es) :

    192.168.105.4


The cause of this DNS registration failure was because of DNS server failure.
This may be due to a zone transfer that has locked the DNS server for the
applicable zone that your computer needs to register itself with.


(The applicable zone should typically correspond to the Adapter-specific
Domain Suffix that was indicated above.) You can manually retry registration
of the network adapter and its settings by typing "ipconfig /registerdns"
at the command prompt. If problems still persist, contact your network
systems administrator to verify network conditions.

Message: The system failed to register pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs)

  Adapter Name : {56AC15EF-0386-45EF-A083-972E551D00C3}

  Sent update to server : 192.175.48.1

  IP Address : 192.168.105.4


The reason that the system could not register these RRs was because
the DNS server refused the update request. The cause of this could
be (a) your computer is not allowed to update the adapter-specified DNS
domain name, or (b) because the DNS server authoritative for the specified
name does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol.


To register the DNS pointer (PTR) resource records using the specific
DNS domain name and IP addresses for this adapter, contact your DNS
server or network systems administrator.
