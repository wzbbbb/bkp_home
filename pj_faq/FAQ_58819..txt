Subject: How to use space in resource's path

Prerequisites:

Application validation tests:

Explanation:

Spaces are not allowed in resource's path.
The work around:
For Unix: to create a soft link for the directory with space

For Windows: use its 8.3 name.
use "dir /x" to get it 8.3 name, and use it:
for example:
07/18/2007  12:03 PM    <DIR>          FINANC~1     financial monthend

Or create a new mount point:
D:\tmp>net use m: "\\USSDMDA007\d$\tmp\financial monthend"
and access it as m:; then unmount it after.
C:\>net use m: /delete
