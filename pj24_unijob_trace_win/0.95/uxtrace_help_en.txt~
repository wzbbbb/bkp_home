Windows UniJob Uxtrace


-.- To launch it
1. Interactively
The Windows uxtrace could be launched by double clicking on the uxtrace.vbs file. It will, then, pop up dialog boxes to ask for parameters.

2. Batch mode
The batch mode makes it possible to launch the uxtrace through an uproc. It provides the same functionality. To launch it in batch mode:

cscript uxtrace.vbs /batch:yes [ /area:{X,S,I,A} /file_level:{0-9} /target:{CS, C, S} ]

Examples:
cscript uxtrace.vbs /batch:YES 
cscript uxtrace.vbs /batch:Y  /area:a 
cscript uxtrace.vbs /batch:y  /file_level:4 /target:C
cscript uxtrace.vbs /batch:y  /file_level:9 /target:C /area:x

-.- The parameters
The Windows uxtrace will accept the same set of parameters as the Unix uxtrace.

Note:  All of the parameter names are case sensitive, but the values are not.

1). The files to be collected

The valid parameters are: 0 - 9
Default Value: 0 (Do not collect any data files)

With value 9, the uxtrace will back all of the data files. For detailed description on which files are collected with which number and how are the files grouped, please check for additional document; or read the script.

2). Tracing Target

Valid parameters are : C, S, CS, SC, SCE, SE, SO, SEO
Default Value: CS

C: to collect UniJob or UniViewer Server related information, with intensive listing result. Similiar to the behavior of the Unix uxtrace, if the related data files are bigger than a threshold value (default 10M), instead of running the "uxlst", the data files will be copied.
S: to collect operating system information, more screenshots, plus registry, etc.
E: to collect Windows event log
O: run the uxtrace and consider the UniJob or UniViewer Server Company shutdown

-.- File generated
The uxtrace result will start with the TMP_ string, will contain the generation time stamp and will be a saved in the ...\app\uxtrace directory.

-.- Sending the result
To prevent the uxtrace result from being removed by antiviruses or email firewall, Orsyp recommends the following 2 alternatives: 

* upload the uxtrace result on your Orsyp ftp directory
* send the uxtrace result with "yousendit" (http://www.yousendit.com) to suppport@orsyp.com
(Please specify the case number in the "Message to recipient")

-.- uxtrace_prerequisite_check.bat
This script is used to check if the envrionemnt, necessary for the Windows uxtrace, is available on a Windows node. This script can be launched by double click on it or from a command window without parameters. This script will call a VBS script version_test.vbs. A text file will be generated, uxtrace_prerequisite_check_output.txt. Please send the uxtrace_prerequisite_check_output.txt file to Technical Support. 
-.- GNU compression and packaging Tools
For your convenience, two releases of the uxtrace are available :
