Easy:	OptionButton5
Expla2:	By default, after the installation of GCO 2.1, only one IO service (for EXP) is created. The GJM needs the IO services started for each targeting area. Please following the recommended procedure to install the IO services for each area.

Objet:	FAQ Request
Op2:	1. Shutdown the Dollar Universe Company and close the Windows Service Panel

2. Create the IO service for the targeting area. For example for APP:
Install the IO service for the APP area: (If you need the INT and SIM areas also, please use the same method.)

Open the file %UXEXE%\[CompanyName]ServInstall.bat
Copy the line that installs the IO service for EXP area and modify it for APP. The command should look like the following:
%UXEXE%\UniServIo   -install [CompanyName] A

3. Add an entry for the IO server in APP to the %UXMGR%\uxstartup_gen.bat file
           %UXEXE%\UniAutoCmd START %SOCIETE% A %NOEUD% IO

4. Add an entry for the IO server in APP to the %UXMGR%\uxshutdown_gen.bat file
           %UXEXE%\uxstpio.exe     %SOCIETE% A  %NOEUD%

Then restart the Dollar Universe Company, and check if the IO server in APP is started. If yes, the GJM should be working in the APP area now.

Pre1:	

Pre2:	Check if you have any patches installed for the GCO 2.1. This issue should be fixed by the upcoming Service Pack for GCO 2.1.
