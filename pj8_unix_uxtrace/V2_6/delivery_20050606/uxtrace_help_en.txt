-- How to implement the version 2.6.0 of the unix uxtrace procedure

-.- Transfer
Transfer the uxtrace_v2.6.0.taz to the mgr directory ($UXMGR) of your Dollar Universe
Company. (this transfer must be done in binary mode).

-.- Go to the mgr directory of your Company:
cd zzz/mgr

-.- Uncompress the taz ball :
mv ./uxtrace_v2.6.0.taz ./uxtrace_v2.6.0.tar.Z
uncompress  ./uxtrace_v2.6.0.tar.Z
tar -xvf ./uxtrace_v2.6.0.tar

-.- Files generated
This procedure will create or replace the following files of your mgr
directory :
uxtrace uxtrace_help_en.txt uxtrace_help_fr.txt

-- How to use the uxtrace procedure (2.6.0)
The following information is also available by typing :
uxtrace -h
(this also displays the uxtrace version.)

-.- Syntax 
uxtrace [-s] [-c] [-L] [-d] [-b] [-h <string>] [ -o] [-p <string>] [-l <num>] [-P] [-a <string>]
	Trace flags :
 	 -s : Traces issues with system symptoms
 	 -c : Traces issues with Dollar Universe misconfiguration symptoms
 	 -L : Lights traces
 	 -p : Will run the specific procedure (variabalized by an argument) at the end of the uxtrace
	 -P : Won't run the standard specific procedure at the end of the uxtrace
	 -l : Nb of days of job log collect (Default : 100 logs will be collected from the main area, and 50 from the other areas)
              [-l <nb of days of job log collected>]
	 -a : Define the main area
 	 -o : Considers that the Dollar Universe company is shutdowned (not recommended)
 	      type uxtrace -h for more information
	Execution modes :
 	 -d : Will divide the uxtrace result into 3 packages instead of one package
 	 -b : Will run the uxtrace in batch mode (No interactive questions)
 	 -h : Displays simple help
 	 -h full : Displays global help (More details about the different options)

-.- Details for the different trace flags
 	 -s : Traces issues with system symptoms
		Defined as issues with system symptoms and/or an issue where Dollar Universe exhibits :
		  - an abnormally long response time
		  - a disproportionate amount of CPU consumption
		  - no longer reacts
 	 -c : Traces issues with Dollar Universe misconfiguration symptoms
		Defined as issues with Dollar Universe misconfiguration symptoms,
		issues regarding dependencies between uprocs, processing date etc ...
 	 -L : Light traces
		Get some light traces to get a low level screenshot of the Dollar Universe company.
		This option disables the -s and the -c options.
 	 -p : Will run a specific procedure (using a variable argument) at the end of the uxtrace
 	 	For example if you wanted to source the following script at the end of the uxtrace :
		${UXMGR}/uxtrace_cust_01
		Use the -p parameter such as -p01, for example uxtrace -scp01
		Please notice that the following default script is always executed (if present) unless -P is specified.
		${UXMGR}/uxtrace_cust
	 -P : Won't run the standard specific procedure at the end of the uxtrace
	 -l : Nb of days of job log collect (Default  : 50 logs will be collected from the main area, and 25 from the other areas)
	        Will collect all the job logs older than the specified value
	 -a : Define the main area
		To use if your issue does not occur in the production area
		for example for APP, it accepts A,a,app,APP
 	 -o : Considers that the Dollar Universe company is shutdowned
 	      A function in the uxtrace procedure automaticaly tests the status of the Dollar Universe Company.
 	      Onlys use the -o flag at DollarAccess's request.
 	      This flag automatically switches the -s flag on
	      
-.- Details of the different execution modes :
	 -d : Will divide the uxtrace result in 3 packages instead of one package
		To facilitate sending the results by e-mail
 	 -b : Will run the uxtrace in batch mode (No interactive questions)

-.- Prerequisites
	It is recommended to copy the uxtrace procedure into the zzz/mgr directory of the Dollar Universe company you want to trace.
	If the trace procedure is not located there, the Dollar Universe environment must be loaded for the company you want to trace.

-.- Examples of issues and how to launch the uxtrace procedure
-..- Dependencies between uprocs
A uproc is in event wait in the production area, but the expected event seems to be present :
To get the most information it is recommended to launch the uxtrace through the following command
uxtrace -c 

If this issue occurs in the application area :
uxtrace -c -aA

If you want to send the result by e-mail, use the -d option to divide the result in small packages :
uxtrace -c -aA -d

-..- The processing date of the uproc ZZZ is wrong
In case this issue occurs in simulation area :
uxtrace -c -aS

If you are used to the messages displayed by the uxtrace procedure
uxtrace -c -aS -b

-..- Dollar Universe is slow and/or consumming an abnormal amount of CPU
You can use :
uxtrace -s

If this is a production crash, and you want to be sure to be abble to send the created packages by e-mail :
uxtrace -s -d

-..- Dollar Universe does not start :
You can use :
uxtrace -s

If this is a production crash, and you want to be sure to be abble to send the created packages by e-mail :
uxtrace -s -d

-..- The uxtrace procedure aborts because of an synthax error in the ${UXMGR}/uxtrace_cust script.
Then please add the -P parameter to not launch this script.

-.- Changing the output directory
How to change the output directory in case there is not enough space left in the mgr directory ?

-..- Doing it for one submission
Assign the path of the directory to the variable UXTRACELOCATE before launching the uxtrace procedure.
For example if you want the tar ball to be created in the /tmp directory :
In ksh or sh :
UXTRACELOCATE=/tmp
export UXTRACELOCATE
In csh :
setenv UXTRACELOCATE /tmp
And then launch the uxtrace procedure.

-..- Changing it permanently
Edit the uxtrace script and look for this section :

#       * modify the folder location of the created uxtrace package
#       * Default value                 ${UXMGR}
#       * Other values possibles        the absolute path of an existant folder
# UXTRACELOCATE="/tmp"

Uncomment the last line and define the new value, for example :

#       * modify the folder location of the created uxtrace package
#       * Default value                 ${UXMGR}
#       * Other values possibles        the absolute path of an existant folder
UXTRACELOCATE="/tmp"

PS By the same method you can also change the UXLOGDELAY parameter (to change how many days of job logs are backuped by the uxtrace procedure)
