Explanation

Normally, the message "Server process not found" means the DQM server is not started or stopped.

There could be different reasons for DQM server missing. In this case, also the most common issue for current DQM structure, the DQM data files are broken; the data file size become 0.

 8271 -rw-rw-rw-   1 root     universe          0 May 15 12:27 /etc/UNIVERSE_DQM_LIDEV1/uxdmpqueLIDEV1X.dat
 8272 -rw-rw-rw-   1 root     universe          0 May 15 12:27 /etc/UNIVERSE_DQM_LIDEV1/uxdmpdtaLIDEV1X.dat


Sometimes, only one of the data files becomes 0 sized. In all case, the DQM server will stop right away, when this happened.

Implementation procedure

To fix this issue,

1). shutdown Dollar Universe
2). delete or rename of the 2 data files
3). restart the Company.

The 2 data files will be recreated. However, all of the previously defined queues will be removed. They have to be recreated and started manually.
