Subject: Achieving special rule with a provoked task

The requirement:


Is there a way to schedule a job on the "day following the last Friday of the month"? 
The schedule has to be triggered the day after the last friday of the month
(it's a monthly job)


Explanation:

This schedule can't be achieved with a rule. However, there is a workaround you may consider.

For example, creating a rule for the last Friday of the month; then the job provokes a task to run the next day. The scheduled task could run at 10:00; and the provoked task's launch window could be 09:00 - 09:30.
