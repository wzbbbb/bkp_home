Subject: 
For some tasks, when disabling and re-enabling a task, one launch is skipped


Prerequisites:

Application validation tests:

When disabling the task, upon enabling of the task, the future launch did not execute, however, the future launch +1 did execute.  (It appears that disabling a task prevents a future launch from executing, but enabling the same task does not also enable the current future launch.)


Explanation:


The behavoir is normal. By default, a disabled task is still generating launches (disabled launches). According to your configuration, those disabled launches may or may not show up in the expected launch window. When a disabled task is re-enabled, the calculator will calculate the next launch. If a disabled launch is already exist, the calculator will go ahead to create the next launch, which looks like it skips one launch.

To change the behavior, not skip a launch when re-enabling task, please define the following and check again.

The following needs to be defined in the shared memory data file, $UXMGR/uxlnm[CompanyName].dat
